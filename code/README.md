# Project Labyrinth

This is a pair-programming project done by Jessica Falk & Fatima Gamero Romero.
We have created a Labyrinth game that renders different background images depending on the coordinates we get from the API. We created reducers and actions in order to display and store different data depending on which actions are dispatched. We also created two thunks to make asynchronous actions when posting data to an API.
We chose to use a loader to create a better UX since the API call delays the flow. All styling is made through React Redux Styled Components.
